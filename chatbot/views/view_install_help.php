      <div class="description">
        In order for a chatbot to be visible and/or usable, it has
        to be marked in the database as active, but there are times
        when you need to disable or hide your chatbot. Changing
        this setting in the admin pages is the best way to handle
        that. If you want folks to be able to use your bot, then
        this needs to be set to TRUE (checked).

      Please note that you <strong>must</strong> have already
      created the database for your bot, though that database can
      be empty (the script will create the necessary tables
      automatically). This is so because many web hosting companies
      do not allow their customers to create new databases except
      through their web hosting control panels. Please have the
      database connection information ready at this point.

        This setting is part of the local database login
        credentials that allow Program O to connect to your bot's
        local database. Under the vast majority of circumstances,
        this is simply 'localhost', but there is the occasional
        rare exception.

        This setting determines the amount of data generated by the
        debugging functions. Here you have a choice of four
        options:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Nothing</b> No debug data is created. Improves bot
            performance by a small amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>General</b> Only basic information is generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>General/SQL</b> In addition to the data generated in
            General, above, all SQL statements are also recorded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Everything</b> The results from a vast number of
            operations, calculations or function calls (sometimes
            several times within certain functions) is generated.
            <b>WARNING!</b> <span class="c1">HUGE</span> amounts of
            data is generated with this setting, to the point where
            script performance will be affected, especially if the
            debug output method is set to "Show in Source". And for
            God's sake, <b>DON'T</b> use this if you're going to
            have debugging data sent to your email!
          </li>
        </ul>For the most part, this should be set to "Nothing",
        unless you're trying to trace a problem with your AIML
        files, and even then, it's best to only use "General". The
        only time the other two settings should be used is to
        troubleshoot the script itself.

      <div class="description">
        Default: File<br>
        "Debug Mode" is a setting to determine which output method
        is used for providing debugging data. This setting allows
        you to choose how to obtain debugging information in the
        following ways:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Show in Source</b> Places debugging data in the
            source code of the page, within HTML comment tags.
            <i>Note - only works when Response Format is set to
            HTML</i>(See below)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>File</b> Creates a debug file that's based on the
            user's internal id and the current time. Stored in the
            /chatbot/debug/ folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Display</b> Prints debugging data directly to the
            screen. <i>Note - only works when Response Format is
            set to HTML</i>(See below)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>email</b> Sends debugging data via email -
            <b>WARNING!</b> can create a <span class=
            "c1">LOT</span> of email traffic! Use sparingly, and
            with care.

        Default: No (disabled)<br>
        If you want to give members extra benefits, such as "Adult
        Oriented" chatbots, or other extra benefits, then this will
        allow you to employ a basic membership system, where users
        would register once, and then login thereafter. This is
        only the most basic of membership systems, though, so there
        is very little in the way of anti-spam measures or age
        verification. If you need something more advanced, let us
        know via <a href="http://www.program-o.com/forum/">the

        This setting is only available if the membership system is
        enabled, above. When this setting is enabled, it will
        require all visitors to log into a registered account.

      <span class="label">File Permissions</span>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          If you've been directed here, then your web server
          doesn't allow the install script to modify file
          permissions automatically. If this is the case, then
          modification of the permissions for the config file will
          have to be done manually, <strong>BEFORE</strong> the
          install script can continue. Otherwise, you'll end up
          with a corrupted installation, and will have to start
          over. This problem seems to be limited to Linux systems,
          since Windows handles file permissions differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          To manually change file permissions on a remote server,
          you usually have a couple of options. If your hosting
          provider provides a user control panel, you can use the
          File Management section to change permissions. You can
          also use the FTP client software that you used to upload
          the file to change permissions. The methods for changing
          file permissions with an FTP client application vary from
          program to program, so if you're unsure about how to go
          about the task, try reading your FTP program's Help file.
          Search for either "file permissions", or "CHMOD". If you
          still need help, feel free to visit the <a href=
          "http://forum.program-o.com/">Program O Support Forum</a>
          to ask for assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correct setting for the file permissions for the
          config file is 755. If you're unsure what this means,
          then have a look at <a href=
          "http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml">http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml</a>
          for a good tutorial about the CHMOD command, and what the
          various settings mean. For our purposes, that setting
          means that the config file can only be written to by the
          file's "owner", while everyone can read and execute the
          file. If the file can't be properly written to, then the
          script can't save the settings that you've set or
          changed, and your bot won't work correctly, so it's
          important that the config file has it's permissions set
          correctly.
