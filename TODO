As of 5/24/14, this is the list of tasks still needed to be undertaken before
Program O_CI can be released:

1.) Design the DB, including adding new tables for the membership system, SRAI lookup,
    and any other new features that will require a DB table.
2.) Redesign the admin pages to be more modular, handle all of the new features, and be
    more mobile-friendly.
3.) Create reliable algorithms to handle <set> and <bot> tags in the AIML pattern searches.
4.) Create similar algorithms to parse AIML templates that support nested tags.
